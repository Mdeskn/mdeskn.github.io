
# Face Detection Project

This project is part of the Python specialization completed by Maede Eskandari Borujerdi. It demonstrates a simple web application built using Flask for detecting faces in uploaded images.

## How It Works

1. **Upload Image**: Users can upload an image file using the provided form.
2. **Detect Faces**: After uploading an image, the application uses OpenCV to detect faces in the image.
3. **Display Results**: Detected faces are outlined in red, and the modified image is displayed back to the user along with the number of faces detected.

## Dependencies

- Flask
- OpenCV
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd face_detection_project
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```
