Face Detection Project
This project is part of the Python specialization completed by Maede Eskandari Borujerdi. It demonstrates a simple web application built using Flask for detecting faces in uploaded images.

How It Works
Upload Image: Users can upload an image file using the provided form.
Detect Faces: After uploading an image, the application uses OpenCV to detect faces in the image.
Display Results: Detected faces are outlined in red, and the modified image is displayed back to the user along with the number of faces detected.
