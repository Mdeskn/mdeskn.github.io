## Quiz App

This is a simple quiz application developed by Maede Eskandari Borujerdi. The application is designed to present users with a series of questions from various topics and provide feedback on their answers.

### How It Works

The quiz application consists of an HTML file (`index.html`), a CSS file (`styles.css`), and a JavaScript file (`script.js`).

#### HTML Structure (`index.html`)

The HTML file contains the structure of the quiz application. It includes elements for displaying the question, choices, feedback, and links to the CSS and JavaScript files.

#### CSS Styling (`styles.css`)

The CSS file provides styles to enhance the visual appearance of the quiz application. It defines the layout, colors, fonts, and other styling properties to create a user-friendly interface.

#### JavaScript Logic (`script.js`)

The JavaScript file contains the logic for the quiz application. It defines an array of quiz questions, each with a topic, question, choices, and correct answer. The questions are shuffled randomly to prevent predictability.

When the quiz starts, the first question is displayed along with multiple-choice options. Users can select an answer by clicking on a button. The application checks if the selected answer matches the correct answer and provides feedback accordingly.

Once all questions are answered, the application displays the total number of correct and incorrect answers.

### Running the Application

To run the quiz application, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The application will load, and users can start taking the quiz immediately.
