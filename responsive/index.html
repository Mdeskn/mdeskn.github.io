      <div><p>Hello there! I'm Mae, born and raised in Iran, with a deep passion for technology and problem-solving. When I'm not immersed in my studies, you can often find me enjoying a good movie, sketching, or working on tech projects. I have a knack for troubleshooting computer and laptop issues, and I'm always happy to lend a helping hand.<br> Welcome to my Portfolio webpage! üë©üèª‚Äçüéìüìö</p></div>

        <h3>High School Diploma</h3>
        <p>I wrapped up my High School Diploma at Mehr Technical and Vocational High School in Borujerd (spells like Borojerd too) City, Lorestan Province, back in June 2013. It was the starting point of my educational adventure. Truth be told, I wasn't the most dedicated student back then, but I soon realized that if I wanted to carve out a successful path, I needed to buckle down and focus on my goals. With a <b>GPA of 16.12/20</b>, I set the stage for my future academic endeavors. üòä</p>

        <h3>Associate of Science (A.S.) in Computer Software</h3>
        <p>I began my journey toward an Associate of Science degree in Computer Software at Islamic Azad University, Borujerd SAMA Technical Vocational College, from October 2015 to June 2017. This phase really got me excited about college life, and I found myself getting more and more invested in my studies. It was during this time that I really hit my stride and became more dedicated to my coursework. Graduating with a <b>GPA of 17.29/20</b> was a pretty awesome validation of all that hard work. üí™üèª</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Professional Engineering of Computer Software</h3>
        <p>I started my Bachelor of Science journey in Professional Engineering of Computer Software at Islamic Azad University, Tehran Central Branch, from October 2021 to June 2023. It was a big step for me, diving deeper into the world of computer software engineering. Throughout those years, I got really into exploring different concepts and methods. Graduating with a <b>GPA of 17.99/20</b> was a real win for me, showing just how much I'd thrown myself into it. üéì</p>
